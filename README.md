<h3>Global filters<font></h3>
  
<p>These are standard filters that are created from one of the views in your desktop and then applied to more than the original worksheet. The term global filter implies that the filter affects every single view in that dashboard, but thatâ€™s not necessarily the case. They could apply to as little as two views, the original view and another.</p>

<h3>Dashboard actions</h3>
  
<p>Dashboard actions are unique features for dashboards. They allow worksheets the ability to interact outside of just the domain of their view. There are three types of dashboard actions: filter actions, highlight actions and URL actions. Filter actions allow the selections in one viz to affect others. This can even be used to navigate between different dashboards. Highlight actions allow you to emphasize the marks in other visualizations by interacting with the source worksheet. The highlight will appear in the same visual style as the Highlighter tool or clicking on a value in the color legend. Finally, a URL action will help the user navigate to a web address from within the dashboard. Dashboard actions will run on three different run on options: select (clicking with your mouse button), hover (moving your mouse cursor over a mark or header) and menu (a text link within the tooltip to activate the dashboard action).</p>
